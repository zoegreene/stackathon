# Cut for Time

http://cut-for-time.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
I created Cut for Time for a week-long hackathon project. The app allows you to create Spotify playlists of a specified duration so you can perfectly plan out your runs, work focus sessions, etc.
To implement the solution, I used Spotify's Web API with Node.js, Express, and React/Redux. The project revolved around creating an efficient implementation of the knapsack problem.

## Features
Cut for Time has currently has the following features:
- Log in to your Spotify account via Spotify's auth
- Specify playlist duration and name
- Playlist is created within your Spotify account from your top saved/liked songs
